# Assignment for Thursday, May 24

## Logical Turtle Exercise

To start off, I'll go ahead and post my logical turtle exercise that we started in class on Tuesday, May 22. 

This code started off as simply the user inputting their age and favorite color and the program producing circles in specific places on the coordinates based on the age. That admittedly is boring and just unacceptable (in the sense that I know I can do something better than that). I struggled in class to really think of a solid idea that made this into a game or something more interactive with the user. I came home. Had a snack (raw cookie dough, if you were curious). Distracted myself a little more with some short YouTube video. And then tried again. 

I started thinking of potential ideas, but all probably involved loops, which I don't know how to do yet. I thought of a few more and actually thought they would be better for the turtlehacks assignment. Ultimately, one idea led to another and I finally decided to make what I had started off with into a guessing game. I realized that although the user gave me specific input values, they have no idea what exactly I did with them. In a way, my program forces the user to work backwards and decipher how I used the main input (age) to create something on the screen and the exact location it was done at. 

I definitely benefited from taking a break in this case. I was experiencing some "programmer's" block (is that a thing?). Any who, here is what I finished up with. Can you go through and figure out the problem without looking at the code?

## Turtlehacks!

Now for the Turtlehacks assignment, I waited until Thursday morning to start it because of work on Wednesday. I also thought, "Oh, I know what I'll do for this one. It'll be easy. Maybe take me an hour! I have all of Thursday to hang out and do homework." Of course that didn't happen. I started this at 9:30am and ended at 4pm, but it still needs so many edits for it to be *"perfect"*.

My initial idea was to do a connect-the-dots followed up with a color-by-number at the end. This is just a connect-the-dots. The 800 lines of code make a car that the user can tell Tina to trace. I aimed to make this as interactive as possible by have the user tell Tina to go forwards, backwards, upwards, and downwards. That makes for a lot of "If-elif-else" statements.

There were several things that were problematic while making this. The most problematic was probably that there were so many "if-elif-else" statements because it caused this cascade of collapseable lines of code and things got extremely confusing. I eventually found out that things weren't in alignment and this also caused problems (it may cause the program to stop for you mid-connecting because I may have missed another alignment mistake). 

Were I to do something like this again, I would have set variables early on, and I would have created a better plan rather than just going for it and quickly losing myself. Creating this definitely made me realize how much code and attention to detail must go into coding much more complex programs than a little connect-the-dots activity. 

Here it is! See if you can spot my errors (or maybe you'll be lucky and pick a route that doesn't have errors!):
