Hi! My name is Rachel Anne and I'm a rising 2nd-year MSIS student. I'm primarily focused on UX, so I am (loosely) following the the HCI track. I work in the SILS library and am an officer for ILSSA, ASIS&T @ UNC, and FLUX (Future Leaders in User eXperience - the new UX student org started by Cami Goray).
