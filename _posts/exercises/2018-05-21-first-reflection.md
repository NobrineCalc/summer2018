Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with embedded Trinket programs for the below three
exercises from Chapter 2 (use these instead of the ones in the book - I added a few explanations).
Complete these on your own, using only the materials in Chapter 2. Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.
