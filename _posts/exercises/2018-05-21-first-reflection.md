Reflections are a HUGE part of this class!  They help your learning sink in and help me understand where your at.

A good reflection involves thinking about your learning.  Metacognition is the fancy word for this.  Take some time to note places where you were stumped, where you got it, how you pushed yourself, and any emotions that accompanied these processes.  Your reflections are an important learning tool for you.  Treat them like that!


# Assignment
