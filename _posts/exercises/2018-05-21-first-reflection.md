Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with embedded Trinket programs for the below three
exercises from Chapter 2 (use these instead of the ones in the book - I added a few explanations).
Complete these on your own, using only the materials in Chapter 2. Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.  
=======
Reflections are a HUGE part of this class!  They help your learning sink in and help me understand where your at.

A good reflection involves thinking about your learning.  Metacognition is the fancy word for this.  Take some time to note places where you were stumped, where you got it, how you pushed yourself, and any emotions that accompanied these processes.  Your reflections are an important learning tool for you.  Treat them like that!
