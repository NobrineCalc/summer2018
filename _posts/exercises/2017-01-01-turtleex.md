Submit a well-formatted pull request to our class blog with embedded Trinket programs for the below exercises.
Complete these on your own, using any materials you need. Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.  

**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
Include a reflection about what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you.
Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?
