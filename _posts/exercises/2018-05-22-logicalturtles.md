___

Create a turtle program that uses **variables**, **conditionals**, **operators**, and **user input**.

You're welcome to use loops for this if that's something you're comfortable with.  Don't use functions
yet.

Make this program responsive to the user input, using **conditionals**.  Get creative! Can you give your
program **replay value?** with your use of conditionals?
