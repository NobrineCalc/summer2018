Submit a [well-formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) pull request to our class blog with embedded Trinket programs for the assignment below.
Complete this on your own, using any class materials you need (including the additional resources on the syllabus). Do not
look at other students' submissions until after you've completed your work.

In your program, remember to leave comments via Python's `#` or using Trinket's [inline comments](https://docs.trinket.io/getting-started-with-trinket-connect#/in-line-comments/using-comments).

**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
Include a reflection about what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you.
Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?
