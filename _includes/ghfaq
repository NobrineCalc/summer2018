## Github Questions

What's a commit?

- A set of line-by-line changes to one or more files in a git repository

What's a branch?

- A version of your source code.  More precisely, it's a sequnce of **commits* that leads to
the branch's current state.

What's the `gh-pages` branch?

- Where Github looks to automatically build a site

What's a Pull Request?

- A social wrapper around the comparison between two branches designed to prepare for *merging* changes

What's a Merge?

- A process of incorporating the commits from one branch into another. Usually done from a Pull Request but also
doable from the command line.

What's a merge conflict?

- When two or more commits specify changes to a single line of a file.  These changes can't be automatically
integrated without potentially using work, so humans need to specify what should happen.
