# Github Review & Opening Issues

To maintain the quality of our site, we're going to help police each others' work. We'll use Github
Issues to do this, just like open source projects do.

Find a partner. On the [people page]({{ site.baseurl }}/people.html) the partner should have:

- First Post
    - Should have a well-formatted title
    - Should display the author's github name
    - Should be formatted like a post

- First Reflection Post
    - Should have a well-formatted title
    - Should display the author's github name
    - Should be formatted like a post

Go to our class repo's Pull Requests tab. Filter by your partner's name. Their Exercises Pull request:
- Should have a well-formatted pull request title
- Should have well-formatted YAML header with the correct `author` (their github name) and `layout: post`
- Should include three trinkets
- Should be in a file that's in their subfolder, titled correctly.

*Note: If you can't find their post on the people page, there's likely something wrong with their
`author:` metadata field.  Look on the main posts page for the post.*

If any of these things are missing, [Open an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/),
no more than one issue per assignment.  Title it intelligibly, something like "@classmate's Turtle post title needs spaces".
If there are multiple issues, you can be broader, like "Formatting issues with @classmate's Turtle post".
In the issue, list the things that are missing. You can make checkboxes if needed like this:

```
- [ ] A checkbox item
```

Be helpful and let your partner know some details of how to fix the error.  [Here's](https://github.com/silshack/spring2016/issues/85)
one I did in a previous class session that a student fixed.

**@mention** your partner on the issue.  Once you all have commit access we'll **assign** issues.

# Handling Issues Assigned to You

If your partner found an issue, no worries!  You have all the tools you need to fix it.  Using the class
notes, how-to sections and/or assignments, fix the issue via a pull request.  In your pull request title or
description, include the phrase "Fixes XX", where XX is the number of the issue.  This will create a
link between your PR and the issue AND when the PR gets merged it will automatically close the issue.  Neat!

In the beginning, issues won't count against you.  We're still gettting the hang of things.  If you have
open issues from me or a classmate, learn why they happened and next time make sure to doublecheck those
specific things.  A large part of being successful in programming is paying attention to details, which
often just means slowing down and/or using internal checkists for yourself.

But as the semester goes on, just like in a professional setting, creating extra work for your peers by
doing low quality work will start to negatively impact my assessement of your work.  So think of these
first issues as FYIs of the things you're still learning.  Soon you'll be expected to get all of this
right every time so that we can focus on the content of your posts.
